# ASL Sentence Classification Project 

# Introduction 
The aim of this project is to create a model that would classify ASL sentences and work in conjunction with previous ASL interpreting models that interpret individual words. The model currently utilizes the Random Forest Tree Classification model and the Support Vector Machine model to classify 2 types of sentences found in ASL (assertions and statements).
