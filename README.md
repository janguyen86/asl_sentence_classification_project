# ASL Sentence Classification Project 

# Introduction 
The aim of this project is to create a model that would classify ASL sentences and work in conjunction with previous ASL interpreting models that interpret individual words. Ideally, this model would be used to preclassify sentences and the individual signs would be interpreted using other models, combining the output of both models to extract the sentence's meaning. The model currently utilizes the Random Forest Tree Classification model and the Support Vector Machine model to classify 2 types of sentences found in ASL (assertions and statements). Assertions (AS) are sentences that declare an action will occur and statements (ST) are sentences that state a fact.
